Hello!

Welcome to my website and thanks for your interest!

I am Punit Kumar Jha.

I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at SandboxAQ. Previously, I used to work at Good Chemistry Inc. a subsidiary of 1QBit, Canada, Vancouver.

My current areas of research include 

- development and use of generative AI models for
    - protein structure prediction,
    - protein-protein and protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, 
    - high-throughput virtual screening.
    - DFT and wavefunction based quantum chemistry.

During my time at Good Chemistry and my PhD, I worked on DFT and wavefunction based quantum chemistry method  development.

My PhD research was based on finite-temperature many-body  perturbation theory at [Prof. So Hirata's](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/hirata/members.html) laboratory.
