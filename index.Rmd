Welcome to my website! Thanks for your interest. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemistry at the [Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://chemistry.illinois.edu/). I work in theoretical and computational chemistry. My reserach is based on finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory at [Prof. So Hirata's](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/hirata/members.html) laboratory. I have successfully published [four reserach publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmN4PKgAAAAJ&hl=en) so far, and currently work on using machine learning and deep learning methods to try to solve problems in chemistry. I am also looking for jobs in industry and postdoctoral postitions in academia.
