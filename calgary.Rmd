- **University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.**
  - Undergraduate Summer Intern, May 2015 - Aug 2015.
      - **Dynamics of gas-hydrate nucleation**: Wrote C++  codes to study the probability distribution of lifetime of gas hydrate cages in the molecular dynamics simulation of  incipient hydrates starting from a CH\textsubscript{4}/H\textsubscript{2}S bubble in liquid H\textsubscript{2}O in a 3D box.
      - Studied the effect of the different guest gas molecules on the lifetime of these cages. }
  - **Skills Acquired:**
          Learned about the object-oriented programming features of C++ and its data structures. I also learned the skills
required to create memory-efficient C++ codes.
