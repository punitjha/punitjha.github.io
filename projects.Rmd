### **<span style="text-decoration: underline">MRI Image Segmentation</span> ** **[<span style="color:magenta">[GitHub]</span>](https://github.com/punitjha/Brain-MRI-Segmentation-U-nets)**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%",out.height="65%",fig.cap="Fig 1 Example 2D slice(s) of the 3D brain image showing both a normal subject (top) and a subject with glioma (bottom). Ref: CS446 UIUC",fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}

```
  - Gliomas are tumors of the brain that involve glial cells in the brain. Gliomas are classified as grades I to IV, where the grades indicate severity of the diseases. 
  - The categories are:
    - Grade I: benign, curable with complete surgical resection, 
    - Grade II: low grade, undergo surgical resection, radiotherapy/chemotherapy,
    - Grade III/IV: high-grade glioma’s, and
    - Grade IV: glioblastoma. 
  - The task is to identify the location of the tumor, and its classification into three groups, namely:
    - edema which indicates inflammation, 
    - enhancing which indicates part of the tumor with active growth , and
    - the necrotic core which are dead tissue, generally in the center).
  - Four different magnetic resonance images (MRI), also known as contrasts are provided for each subject, namely,
    - T1-weighted which this tends to be higher intensity with tissues with more lipids,
    - T2-weighted which is usually higher intensity for tissues with more water,
    - FLAIR this is similar to T2 but free water is suppressed, and
    - T1CE this is same as T1, but with a contrast agent injected to brighten certain patterns).
  - After training on labelled images the task was to to predict the segmentation of unlabelled images in the test set. This is also known as semantic segmentation in computer vision and this project was carried out as a part of CS 446: Machine Learning at UIUC.
  - For more details and codes please refer to [<span style="color:red">here.</span>](https://github.com/punitjha/Brain-MRI-Segmentation-U-nets) 
  - All calculations were run on Google Cloud. 
  - A few slices from results are shown below:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",out.height="75%",fig.cap="Results obtained from the U-net model",fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}

```  

<!-- Each sample is a tensor of size = 4 x height (H) x width (W) x depth (D), where the four 3D tensors represent the a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), c) T2-weighted (T2), and d) T2-FLAIR contrasts (images) of the brain MRI. Note that different samples may have slightly different dimensions H, W, and D -- your are models should be able to handle this. For training samples, you are also provided with a HxWxD label “image”, with a label for each voxel (3D pixel). Your task is to predict the segmentation of unlabelled images. This is also known as semantic segmentation in computer vision. Beyond the course notes, you can find some straightforward descriptions here, and here Note that the output dimension for each sample is of size H x W x D. -->

  - ORP titled, **On the inclusion of long-range interactions among molecules in machine learning models**.
  - Developed an ORP on the problem of inclusion of long-range (electrostatic) interactions in machine learning algorithms. Analyzed different neural network schemes, especially deep high-dimensional neural networks (HDNNs), and whether they can efficiently learn and predict molecular charges learned from various charge partitioning schemes.
  - I studied different charge partitioning schemes like Hirshfeld, Charge Model 5, Merz-Singh-Kollman, and Natural Bonding Orbital methods used in molecular dynamics simulations.
  - Proposed modifications to the existing mathematical formulation and structure of HDNNs to be able to better predict  molecular charges, the computational cost for implementing the project, potential  setbacks, and alternate plans for the project.
