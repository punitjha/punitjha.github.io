    - Using 1400 abstracts of journal articles created an information retrieval system that takes in a query and outputs the top matched abstracts using TF-IDF weights and cosine similarity scores.
    - This project was a part of the ECE 365: Data Science and Engineer course.
    - More details of the project can be found in this repository [here](https://github.com/punitjha/ECE365-Data_Science_and_Engineering/tree/master/NLP_Lab5)

2. **Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems**:
    - Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm for computer serves  based on the Gaussian model.
    - Implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm for a dataset of movie ratings.
     - This project was a part of the Machine learning class by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
