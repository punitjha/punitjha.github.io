### Machine Learning and Programming Projects

- Anomaly Detection:Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm for computer serves  based on Gaussian model.
- Recommender Systems: Implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm for a dataset of movie ratings.
- Ad Hoc Information Retrieval System: Using 1400 abstracts of journal articles created an information retrieval system that takes in a query and outputs the top matched abstracts using TF-IDF weights and cosine similarity scores.

  <!--   - Reactive molecular dynamics of hydrocarbon dissociation on Ni surface: Carried out reactive dynamics simulations of the adsorption and decomposition of CH\textsubscript{4} molecules interacting with a Ni(100) surface. Studied the temperature dependence of chemisorption of CH\textsubscript{4} by breakage of C-H bonds that leads to the formation of CH\textsubscript{3} and H radical on a Ni(100) surface. -->
  <!-- - **Skills Acquired:** -->
  <!--         Learned rogramming in FORTRAN 90 and how to carry out quantum mechanical simulations using ReaxFF. -->
             
             
             
<!--     - Finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (FT-MBPT): FT-MBPT is a theory to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of the grand canonical system at a given temperature.  -->
  <!--     - I implemented the $\lambda$-variation method to  calculate the $n$th-order corrections to grand potential and internal energy using the FT-MBPT formalism which showed it is mathematically inconsistent and does not conserve charge.  -->
  <!--     - Derived the correct analytic formulas for FT-MBPT using another ansatz wherein charge was conserved. -->
  <!--     Implemented the FT-MBPT in a canonical ensemble and derived semi-analytic formulas. -->
  <!-- - **Original Research Proposal (ORP)** -->
  <!--       - Developed an ORP on the problem of inclusion of long-range (electrostatic) interactions in machine learning algorithms. Analyzed different neural network schemes,            especially deep high-dimensional neural networks (HDNNs), and whether they can efficiently learn and predict molecular charges learned from various charge partitioning schemes. -->
  <!--     - Studied different charge partitioning schemes like Hirshfeld, Charge Model 5, Merz-Singh-Kollman, and Natural Bonding Orbital methods used in molecular dynamics              simulations. -->
  <!--     - Proposed modifications to mathematical formulation and structure of HDNNs to be able to better predict  molecular charges, computational cost for implementing the            project, potential  setbacks, and alternate plans for the project. -->
  <!-- - **Skills Acquired:** -->
  <!--         Acquired knowledge of \textit{ab initio} and DFT electronic structure methods. Learned about machine learning algorithms. Learned to program in Python and enhanced           my programming skills in C++ and FORTRAN. -->

  <!--   - Diagonal suppressed constant time Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY): Worked on a novel NMR pulse sequence to achieve diagonal suppressed COSY (correlation spectroscopy) spectra with high sensitivity and absorptive cross peak line-shapes.              -->
  <!--   - Carried out simulations and  product operator  calculations for 2, 3, and 4 spin systems using the novel NMR pulse sequence. -->
  <!--   - Implemented various optimization strategies for the pulse sequence that included the addition of water suppression module, removing axial and multiple quantum peaks by using gradient fields, etc.  -->
  <!-- - **Skills Acquired:** -->
  <!--         Acquired programming skills to program in the TopSpin 2.1 programming language and  learned to how to perform 1D, 2D NMR experiments on a 400 MHz spectrometer. -->

  <!-- ---     -->
  
  
   <!-- - Quantum reactive flux theory: Studied the quantum analog of classical non-Markovian Kramers' equation and the phase space distribution function formulation of the method of reactive flux in the memory friction regime. Analyzed quantum Kramers' equation for energy diffusion and barrier crossing dynamics in the high-friction regime. -->
   <!--  - **Skills Acquired:** -->
   <!--        Acquired skills to use Mathematica for solving integrals and numerical analysis. Learned mathematical methods in physics. -->

<!--       - Dynamics of gas-hydrate nucleation: Wrote C++  codes to study the probability distribution of lifetime of gas hydrate cages in the molecular dynamics simulation of  incipient hydrates starting from a CH\textsubscript{4}/H\textsubscript{2}S bubble in liquid H\textsubscript{2}O in a 3D box. -->
<!--       - Studied the effect of the different guest gas molecules on the lifetime of these cages. } -->
