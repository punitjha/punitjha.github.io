      - Finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (FT-MBPT): FT-MBPT is a theory to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of the grand canonical system at a given temperature. 
      - I implemented the $\lambda$-variation method to  calculate the $n$th-order corrections to grand potential and internal energy using the FT-MBPT formalism which showed it is mathematically inconsistent and does not conserve charge. 
      - Derived the correct analytic formulas for FT-MBPT using another ansatz wherein charge was conserved.
      Implemented the FT-MBPT in a canonical ensemble and derived semi-analytic formulas.
  - **Original Research Proposal (ORP)**
        - Developed an ORP on the problem of inclusion of long-range (electrostatic) interactions in machine learning algorithms. Analyzed different neural network schemes,            especially deep high-dimensional neural networks (HDNNs), and whether they can efficiently learn and predict molecular charges learned from various charge partitioning schemes.
      - Studied different charge partitioning schemes like Hirshfeld, Charge Model 5, Merz-Singh-Kollman, and Natural Bonding Orbital methods used in molecular dynamics              simulations.
      - Proposed modifications to mathematical formulation and structure of HDNNs to be able to better predict  molecular charges, computational cost for implementing the            project, potential  setbacks, and alternate plans for the project.
  - **Skills Acquired:**
          Acquired knowledge of \textit{ab initio} and DFT electronic structure methods. Learned about machine learning algorithms. Learned to program in Python and enhanced           my programming skills in C++ and FORTRAN.
