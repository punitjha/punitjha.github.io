  - **Summary**:
      - **Finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (FT-MBPT)**: FT-MBPT is a theory to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of the grand canonical system at a given temperature. 
      - I implemented the $\lambda$-variation method to  calculate the $n$th-order corrections to grand potential and internal energy using the FT-MBPT formalism which showed it is mathematically inconsistent and does not conserve charge. 
      - Derived the correct analytic formulas for FT-MBPT using another ansatz wherein charge was conserved.
      Implemented the FT-MBPT in a canonical ensemble and derived semi-analytic formulas.
  - **Skills Acquired:**
          Acquired knowledge of \textit{ab initio} and DFT electronic structure methods. Learned about machine learning algorithms. Learned to program in Python and enhanced my programming skills in C++ and FORTRAN.
