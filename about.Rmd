I completed my PhD in  Chemistry at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://chemistry.illinois.edu/) in 2021.
  
I did my undergraduate and master's in chemistry at the [National Institute of Science Education and Reserach](https://www.niser.ac.in/), Bhubaneswar, India. My M.Sc. research project on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and I worked with 2D NMR experiments. For general details on my Ph.D. research and the projects that I have worked on please see the ["Projects"](https://punitjha.github.io/projects.html) section of my website.
